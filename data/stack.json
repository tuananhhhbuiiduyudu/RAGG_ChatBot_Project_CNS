Can go to an LLM or an output node.\n\nStack AI offers a Basic DB, which is a vector database that runs in memory without sending the data source to an external tool.\nThe basic DB does not store embeddings after the flow stops running and hence recomputes embeddings at every run. It is only recommended for advanced document analysis applications.Was this page helpful?YesNoNotionPython CodetwittergithublinkedindiscordPowered by MintlifyAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.",

If you\u2019d like to have a feature which we don\u2019t support yet, or want\nto provide some feedback, feel free to reach out to us directly to\nfounders@stack-ai.com\n\u200bWhatsApp with Twilio\nUsing Twilio to set up a WhatsApp number involves a few steps. Here\u2019s a general outline to get started:\n\u200b1. Sign Up for Twilio and Enable WhatsApp Sandbox:\n\nSign up for a Twilio account if you haven\u2019t already.\nNavigate to the WhatsApp section in the Twilio Console.\nHere you\u2019ll find the WhatsApp Sandbox.\nWhile you\u2019re testing, you can use the sandbox environment provided by Twilio to send and receive messages without connecting to an official business profile. We\u2019ll show later how to connect to an official business profile.\n\n\u200b2. Test with Twilio Sandbox:\n\nYou\u2019ll see a sandbox number and a code.\nTo activate your personal number for testing, send the given code to the sandbox number from your personal WhatsApp.\nOnce activated, any messages sent to the sandbox number will be relayed to your Twilio account.\n\n\u200b3. Set Up Webhook to connect Twilio with Stack AI:\nTo make your number interactive (i.e., send and receive messages), let\u2019s set up a webhook that will connect Twilio to Stack AI.\n\nOnce you have built your Stack AI flow, click on \u2018Publish\u2019 at the top-right of the flow builder (next to the \u2018Run\u2019 button).\nOnce published, click on \u2018Export\u2019 at the top-right of the flow builder.\nYou will be prompted with the Export wizard.\n\nIn the Export tab, follow these steps:\n\nOn the top-left dropdown, select \u2018WhatsApp/SMS\u2019.\n1.1. Select Input and Output node\nMake sure you select at least one input and one output.\nThese will be used to receive (input) and send (output) messages to WhatsApp.\n1.2 Account SID. You can find your Account SID in Twilio\u2019s console.\nPlease, select the LIVE credentials rather than the test ones.\n1.3 Auth Token. You can find your Auth Token in Twilio\u2019s console.\nPlease, select the LIVE credentials rather than the test ones.\n1.2. Webhook URL.\nFinally, copy/paste Stack AI\u2019s webhook URL into Twilio\u2019s Sandbox Settings.\nIf the webhook URL (starting with ) contains a placeholder <YOUR_API_KEY>, you need to click on \u2018Show Token\u2019 to display your API key. - Copy the webhook URL displayed. Make sure your API key is filled in.\n\nGo back to Twilio\u2019s \u201cSandbox settings\u201d tab, and find the Sandbox Configuration section.\nPaste the webhook URL in the When a message comes in field, inside the Sandbox Configuration section.\nMake sure the Method is set to POST\nThe Status callback URL can be left blank.\n\n\u200bDevelop and Test your Application\n\nWhenever a user sends a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number, Twilio will make a request to your webhook URL. Your Stack AI flow can then decide how to respond, using Twilio to send a reply back to the user.\nSend a message to WhatsApp and confirm that you are receiving an answer from Stack AI.\nIf this doesn\u2019t work, repeat the previous steps or contact us at support@stack-ai.com\n\n\u200bMove to Production\n\nOnce you\u2019re done with sandbox testing, you can apply to have your business profile approved by WhatsApp.\nNavigate to Twilio\u2019s WhatsApp Request Form and fill it out.\nAfter you get approval, you\u2019ll connect your business profile with Twilio, and you can start sending messages to all users without them having to join the sandbox.\n\nAlways follow WhatsApp\u2019s policies and guidelines when sending and receiving messages. Avoid spammy behaviors as WhatsApp is strict, and misuse can lead to the banning of your business profile.\nAlways refer to the official Twilio and WhatsApp documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\u200bFAQ\nMy StackAI WhatsApp bot stopped working after 24h.\n\nIf you are using Twilio\u2019s Sandbox, you will need to send a message, something along the lines of join solid-water send to activate for 24 more hours. Make sure you redo the Sandbox initialization that you can find on Twilio\u2019s website.

It involves the use of models trained to generate new data that mimic the distribution of the training data. Generative AI can create a wide array of content, including but not limited to text, images, music, and even synthetic voices.\n\u200bWhat is an LLM?\nLLM stands for Large Language Model. These models, such as GPT-4, are a type of artificial intelligence model that uses machine learning to produce human-like text.\nLarge Language Models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate sentences by predicting the likelihood of a word given the previous words used in the text. They can be fine-tuned for a variety of tasks, including translation, question-answering, and writing assistance.\nThese models are called \u201clarge\u201d because they have a huge number of parameters. For example, GPT-4, one of the largest models as of today, has about 1.8 trillion adjustable parameters. Their large parameter count allows these models to capture a wide range of language patterns and nuances, but also makes them computationally expensive to train and use.\n\u200bWhat type of applications can I build with Generative AI?\nGenerative AI models have a wide range of potential applications across numerous fields. Here are some examples:\n\nContent Creation: These models can generate new pieces of text, music, or artwork. For example, AI could create music for a video game, generate a script for a movie, or produce articles or reports.\n\nChatbots and Virtual Assistants: Generative models can be used to create conversational agents that can carry on a dialogue with users, generating responses to user queries in a natural, human-like manner.\n\nImage Generation and Editing: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic images, design graphics, or even modify existing images in significant ways, such as changing day to night or generating a person\u2019s image in the style of a specific artist.\n\nProduct Design: AI can be used to generate new product designs or modify existing ones, potentially speeding up the design process and introducing new possibilities that human designers might not consider.\n\nMedical Applications: Generative AI can be used to create synthetic medical data, simulate patient conditions, or predict the development of diseases.\n\nPersonalized Recommendations: AI models can generate personalized content or product recommendations based on user data.\n\nData Augmentation: In situations where data is scarce, generative models can be used to create synthetic data to supplement real data for training other machine learning models.\n\n\u200bWhat is an embedding?\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of concepts converted to number sequences, which make it easy for computers to understand the relationships between those concepts. They are capable of capturing the context of a word in a document, its semantic and syntactic similarity, and its relation with other words.\n\u200bWhat is a vector store?\nA vector store in the context of machine learning is a storage system or database designed to handle vector data efficiently. Vector data is commonly used in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, where high-dimensional vectors are used to represent complex data like words, sentences, or images.\nVectors stores are often optimized for operations that are common in machine learning, like nearest neighbor search, which involves finding the vectors in the store that are closest to a given vector. This is particularly useful in tasks like recommendation systems, where you might want to find the items that are most similar to a given item.\n\u200bWhat is a multimodal model?\nA multimodal model in the field of artificial intelligence is a model that can handle and integrate data from multiple different modalities, or types, of input. These types of inputs can include text, images, audio, video, and more.\nThe main advantage of multimodal models is that they can leverage the strengths of different data types to make better predictions. For example, a model that takes both text and image data as input might be able to understand the context better than a model that only uses one or the other.\n\u200bWhat is the memory of an LLM?\nA Large Language Model (LLM) can generate text based on what it has seen before if it has memory. The term \u201cmemory\u201d in this context refers to how much of the previous text the model can consider when producing new text.\nMemory is a different concept than the training set used to train the model. The model can answer things from what it knows given the training set that is was given. Additionally, considering that you are chatting with chatGPT, the model will respond to your queries considering the last responses and queries as well. This \u201cmemory\u201d of the model is indeed crucial when dealing with long pieces of text or conversations, as it determines how much of the previous context the model can use to generate accurate and coherent responses.Was this page helpful?YesNoPlatform OverviewTutorialstwittergithublinkedindiscordPowered by MintlifyOn this pageWhat is generative AI?What is an LLM?What type of applications can I build with Generative AI?What is an embedding?What is a vector store?What is a multimodal model?What is the memory of an LLM?AssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.",

Users can customize fields to include text, numbers, drop-down lists, attachments, and even links to other tables.\nThis combination provides the flexibility of spreadsheets with the structure and relational capabilities of databases,\nallowing for varied applications ranging from content calendars and CRM systems to project management and inventory tracking.\n\u200bHow to use it?\n\n\u200bConnections to an Airtable node\nTo utilize the Airtable node, you must establish connections to both its input and output nodes.\n\n Input:  This node necessitates an Airtable formula. You can either\nspecify the Airtable formula in an Input node, or use an LLM to transtale your\nrequest into an Airtable formula (see the template below)\n Output:  The node produces a JSON object containing data from\nthe designated Airtable table. For viewing results, connect the output to an Output\nnode. If you\u2019re working with the LLM, ensure you\u2019re aware of the context window.\nFor extensive results, consider linking to a Vector database.\n\nAdditionally, you will need to link the node with an account. Click on the Connect to Airtable button and link it to your account.\nOnce done this, you will be able to specify some required parameters.\n\n Personal access token:  your personal ID to identify yourself\nto Airtable.\n Base:  an Airtable \u201cbase\u201d is essentially a database within the\nAirtable platform. Each base is made up of a collection of tables, similar to sheets\nin a spreadsheet or tables in a traditional database.\n Table:  this is the table object that you\u2019d like to connect to.\n Search Type:  this is the mechanism over which to load data from\nairtable: - Formula: Runs an airtable formula to get the answer. Ideal for questions\nthat involve looking for precise data matches \u201cGive the emails of users older than\n21 years\u201d. - Semantic: Runs a semantic search over the rows of the table. Ideal\nfor questions that look for facts in specific rows \u201cList users with names similar\nto Andrew\u201d.\n\n\u200bAirtable node connection parameters\n\u200bExample of usage\nA practical application of Airtable involves integrating it with an AI assistant designed to answer user queries based on context data stored in Airtable.\n\n\u200bAnswering questions from users using Airtable data\nTo construct this workflow, employ an LLM to address the users\u2019 inquiries. Incorporate an Input node to funnel the users\u2019 submissions, and link an Airtable node to a dedicated account.\nFurthermore, a secondary LLM facilitates the conversion of user requests into Airtable formulas. The prompts for this supplementary LLM are as follows:\n\u200bSystem prompt (LLM 0) \nCopyAsk AIYou convert user questions into Airtable formulas. You only respond with airtable formulas that can be used as filters.\n\nExample:\n\nUser: hello\nAssistant: FIND(\"fox\", \"quick brown fox\")\n\nUser: Is the word Bernardo in the name?\nAssistant: SEARCH(\"Bernardo\", {{name}}) > 0\n\nUser: What is the age of Bernardo?\nAssistant: {{NAME}} = 'Bernardo'\n\nCRITICAL: Your responses always are valid formulas.\n\n\u200b Prompt (LLM 0) \nCopyAsk AIMy Airtable has the following columns:\n\n| Column | Type |\n| < Name of Column 1> | <Type of Column 1> |\n| < Name of Column 2> | <Type of Column 2> |\n\nAnswer the following question: {in-0}\n\nFor the other LLM (the one answering the user\u2019s questions), the prompts used in this example are the following:\n\u200b System prompt (LLM 1) \nCopyAsk AIYou are a helpful AI assistant. You will be given data from an Airtable database\nto answer questions. Be conversational with the user.\n\n\u200b Prompt (LLM 1) \nCopyAsk AIAirtable formula used:\n\n---\n\n## {llm-0}\n\nResponse from Airtable:\n\n---\n\n## {airtable-0}\n\nUser message: {in-0}\n\nWas this page helpful?YesNoText to ImageGoogle SearchtwittergithublinkedindiscordPowered by MintlifyOn this pageWhat is Airtable?Node in Stack AIHow to use it?Connections to an Airtable nodeAirtable node connection parametersExample of usageAnswering questions from users using Airtable dataSystem prompt (LLM 0)  Prompt (LLM 0)  System prompt (LLM 1)  Prompt (LLM 1) AssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.",

Use the following instructions (taken from the AWS documentation).\n\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.\n\nIn the Buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that contains the object that you want as a pre-signed URL.\n\nIn the Objects list, select the object for which you want to create a pre-signed URL.\n\nOn the Actions menu, choose Share with a pre-signed URL.\n\nSpecify how long you want the pre-signed URL to be valid.\n\nChoose \u2018Create pre-signed URL\u2019.\n\nWhen a confirmation appears, the URL is automatically copied to your clipboard. You will see a button to copy the pre-signed URL if you need to copy it again.\n\nThis will generate an URL with the following structure:\nCopyAsk AIhttps://<BUCKET>.s3.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/<FILE>?response-content-disposition=inline&X-Amz-Security-Token=<TOKEN>\n\nPre-signed URLs have a maximum duration of 12 hours.\n\u200bHow to add the URL to a Stack AI flow\nYou can load the document with its signed URL to a URL data loader (see ) which will load and parse the PDF to a vector database.\nGo to the Deploy section and you can call specify the signed URL in the inputs of the flow.

Users can customize fields to include text, numbers, drop-down lists, attachments, and even links to other tables.\nThis combination provides the flexibility of spreadsheets with the structure and relational capabilities of databases,\nallowing for varied applications ranging from content calendars and CRM systems to project management and inventory tracking.\n\u200bHow to use it?\n\n\u200bConnections to an Airtable node\nTo utilize the Airtable node, you must establish connections to both its input and output nodes.\n\n Input:  This node necessitates an Airtable formula. You can either\nspecify the Airtable formula in an Input node, or use an LLM to transtale your\nrequest into an Airtable formula (see the template below)\n Output:  The node produces a JSON object containing data from\nthe designated Airtable table. For viewing results, connect the output to an Output\nnode. If you\u2019re working with the LLM, ensure you\u2019re aware of the context window.\nFor extensive results, consider linking to a Vector database.\n\nAdditionally, you will need to link the node with an account. Click on the Connect to Airtable button and link it to your account.\nOnce done this, you will be able to specify some required parameters.\n\n Personal access token:  your personal ID to identify yourself\nto Airtable.\n Base:  an Airtable \u201cbase\u201d is essentially a database within the\nAirtable platform. Each base is made up of a collection of tables, similar to sheets\nin a spreadsheet or tables in a traditional database.\n Table:  this is the table object that you\u2019d like to connect to.\n Search Type:  this is the mechanism over which to load data from\nairtable: - Formula: Runs an airtable formula to get the answer. Ideal for questions\nthat involve looking for precise data matches \u201cGive the emails of users older than\n21 years\u201d. - Semantic: Runs a semantic search over the rows of the table. Ideal\nfor questions that look for facts in specific rows \u201cList users with names similar\nto Andrew\u201d.\n\n\u200bAirtable node connection parameters\n\u200bExample of usage\nA practical application of Airtable involves integrating it with an AI assistant designed to answer user queries based on context data stored in Airtable.\n\n\u200bAnswering questions from users using Airtable data\nTo construct this workflow, employ an LLM to address the users\u2019 inquiries. Incorporate an Input node to funnel the users\u2019 submissions, and link an Airtable node to a dedicated account.\nFurthermore, a secondary LLM facilitates the conversion of user requests into Airtable formulas. The prompts for this supplementary LLM are as follows:\n\u200bSystem prompt (LLM 0) \nCopyAsk AIYou convert user questions into Airtable formulas. You only respond with airtable formulas that can be used as filters.\n\nExample:\n\nUser: hello\nAssistant: FIND(\"fox\", \"quick brown fox\")\n\nUser: Is the word Bernardo in the name?\nAssistant: SEARCH(\"Bernardo\", {{name}}) > 0\n\nUser: What is the age of Bernardo?\nAssistant: {{NAME}} = 'Bernardo'\n\nCRITICAL: Your responses always are valid formulas.\n\n\u200b Prompt (LLM 0) \nCopyAsk AIMy Airtable has the following columns:\n\n| Column | Type |\n| < Name of Column 1> | <Type of Column 1> |\n| < Name of Column 2> | <Type of Column 2> |\n\nAnswer the following question: {in-0}\n\nFor the other LLM (the one answering the user\u2019s questions), the prompts used in this example are the following:\n\u200b System prompt (LLM 1) \nCopyAsk AIYou are a helpful AI assistant. You will be given data from an Airtable database\nto answer questions. Be conversational with the user.\n\n\u200b Prompt (LLM 1) \nCopyAsk AIAirtable formula used:\n\n---\n\n## {llm-0}\n\nResponse from Airtable:\n\n---\n\n## {airtable-0}\n\nUser message: {in-0}\n\nWas this page helpful?YesNoText to ImageGoogle SearchtwittergithublinkedindiscordPowered by MintlifyOn this pageWhat is Airtable?Node in Stack AIHow to use it?Connections to an Airtable nodeAirtable node connection parametersExample of usageAnswering questions from users using Airtable dataSystem prompt (LLM 0)  Prompt (LLM 0)  System prompt (LLM 1)  Prompt (LLM 1) AssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.",
